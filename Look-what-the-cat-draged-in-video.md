# look what the cat draged in video

- The video was showing us the person had a problem with his cat always bringing in dead animals that it had killed or bringing things from the outside inside the house creating a horible smell and a shock for the owner.
- The man didnt want to kick the cat out for good so he decided he wanted to keep the cat out but if it detected somthing irregular it wouldnt allow the cat to come back in.
- he needed to learn machine learning and to learn how to code for this to be true.
- so he learned how to code through online sevices with ease and he made a contraption that would suit what he wanted.
